          <div><h3><i><p>Takeshi Goda ( Gōda Takeshi) usually known by the nickname "Gian" (「ジャイアン」, "Jaian", English: Big G) 
            is a strong and quick-tempered local bully. He frequently steals other children's stuff (especially Nobita's and Suneo's) under
             the pretext of "borrowing" them, unless the toy is damaged. He is known for his awful singing voice, though he considers himself a great 
             singer. To prove this, Gian sometimes "invites" others to attend his concerts, under the threat of beatings. His singing is so horrible 
             that it causes nausea in listeners; once when Nobita and Doraemon try to mute it in a silent world, Gian's writing of the lyrics on a 
             board have the same nausea-causing effect. Though his voice is terrible, in one of the episodes it was shown that a girl liked his singing.
              In some films, his singing is enhanced to become an effective weapon (as in 'Nobita's Great Adventure in the South Seas'). In some 
              episodes when his voice is recorded and he hears the recording, he instantly denies it is his voice and threatens to beat up the person
               who sang his songs badly. Gian is also confident in cooking, but just like his singing, his hand-made food can be a nightmare for other 
               people very easily.</p></i></h3></div>
       
           <div><h3><i><p>However, Gian does not hesitate to help his friends when they are in real trouble. Throughout the series, particularly 
            the films, he is often the one who voices the most concern and refuses to look away when there is a problem, in contrast to Suneo's
            cowardice. While he is described by others as daunting and intimidating, he is very sensitive and prone to crying when something touching 
            happens, and he actually values his friends highly, a feeling which his friends sometimes reciprocate. Gian also has a soft spot for his
            younger sister, Jaiko, and usually tries to prevent her from getting into trouble, even if she can handle the situation herself.
            Gian is basically a bullying 'tsundere'.</p></i></h3></div>
