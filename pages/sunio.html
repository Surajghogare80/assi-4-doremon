          <div><h3><i><p>Suneo Honekawa (骨川 スネ夫, Honekawa Suneo) is the fox-faced (inherited from his mother) rich child who loves to flaunt his
             material wealth before everyone, especially Nobita. A lot of the stories start with Suneo showing off some new video game, toy or pet which
              evokes Nobita's envy. He is often seen with Gian, teasing Nobita. He also often pushes Nobita aside with silly excuses while he invites
               Gian and Shizuka to his parties or resorts. However, he is actually one of Nobita's closest friends, who would often ask for his and
                Doraemon's help. In the films, Suneo is often the one most reluctant to take part in Nobita and Doraemon's adventures, and he also 
                tries to face as little trouble as possible and go home, unless others convince him, making him somewhat a coward. He has an extensive
                 knowledge of science, and is a talented artist and designer, besides being extremely cunning.</p></i></h3></div>
       
           <div><h3><i><p>In some scenes, Suneo is seen as a narcissist who loves to stare at himself in the mirror while telling himself that h
            e is the most handsome guy in the world. His habit of bragging often lands him into trouble. Suneo is also very self-conscious about his
             height, being the shortest kid in his class. He likes steak and melon. Suneo often tries to win Shizuka's favour and is a close friend of 
             Gian.</p></i></h3></div>
