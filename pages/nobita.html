        <div><h3><i><p>Nobita Nobi is a fictional character in the Doraemon anime and manga series created by Fujiko Fujio, the pen name of writing 
            team Hiroshi Fujimoto and Motoo Abiko. He is also the main character in The Doraemons (special version). Known as Sidney, Nobi Nobi and
             Noby in some English localizations of the anime, Nobita is usually depicted as an elementary school student. His parents are Nobisuke 
             and Tamako Nobi, and he is perpetually looked after by Doraemon, a robotic cat from the future sent back in 
             time by Nobita's descendant.</p></i></h3></div>
       
          <div><h3><i><p>Nobita's characterization depicts him as a lazy and flawed person, including but not limited to a lack of physical
             co-ordination or athletic talent, predisposition to laziness, reluctance to engage in critical thinking, and sometimes exhibits
              childish or even perverted behavior. He dislikes books and lacks a basic grasp of knowledge, such as being unable to understand
               concepts such as the definition of an eclipse. He often takes any chance to take a nap and is often known as 'The Lazy King'.
                In a typical episode, Nobita begs Doraemon to lend him a gadget to get revenge on his bully classmates, Gian and Suneo, show off 
                to his classmate and future love interest, Shizuka Minamoto, or to provide convenience for himself such as getting his homework 
                done quicker. Whenever he possesses Doraemon's gadgets, he almost always abuses the gadget's power to the point that the effect backfires
                 on him. He envies his classmate Hidetoshi Dekisugi, a straight-A student admired by all of the girls in his class, including Shizuka.
                  Nobita's typical day consists of arriving late to school, falling asleep during class, scoring low marks on his tests, getting 
                  scolded by his teacher and teased by Gian and Suneo, falling in the curbside rain gutters, getting chased by dogs, getting scolded
                   by his mother for not completing his tasks, and being bullied by people he knows, except Shizuka.</p></i></h3></div>
       
           <div><h3><i><p>Even though Nobita possesses many questionable character traits, he occasionally displays redeeming qualities such as 
            kind-heartedness, courage, and even a good work ethic. In some full-length stories he has risked his life to help save others, or even
             entire civilizations. In some episodes, it is implied that his poor academic grades is due to his lazy nature as opposed to a lack of
              intellectual ability. Nobita is known for his sharp gunfiring abilities and also skilful in the game of Cat's cradle as shown in many
               episodes. The character has also demonstrated creativity when it comes to utilizing Doraemon's gadgets in novel ways. For example,
                in one instance he finds a way to profitably use a gadget called the "broadcasting mirror" for advertising, even when Doraemon himself 
                couldn't think of any use for it. Other examples include his ability to co-opt free flying with the use of Doraemon's "power of wind" 
                fans, which can create a gust of wind with just a gentle swish, and his use of the voice hardener, which is considered useless by 
                Doraemon, for transportation. Nobita's creativity is the proof enough of his high intelligence. Also he has extensive knowledge about 
                science, environment and Doraemon's gadgets.</p></i></h3></div>
