   <div><h3><i><p>Nobita Nobi (野比 のび太, Nobi Nobita) is the co-protagonist of the series. He wears glasses, a red or yellow polo shirt with a white
     collar, and blue or black shorts and white socks and light blue shoes. Although he's not good at sports, he's good at shooting and has been
      reflected in the movies many time. He's also good at string figure which sometime considered a girl's game. Son of Tamako and Nobisuke Nobi.
       Future father of Nobisuke (his son). Future husband or boyfriend of Shizuka and great-great-grandfather of Sewashi.</p></i></h3></div>

   <div><h3><i><p>She sometimes fancies handsome idols on TV. Besides Nobita, Shizuka is also close to her classmate and popular student Dekisugi,
     though they consider each other only as friends.</p></i></h3></div>

    <div><h3><i><p>Shizuka likes to bathe several times a day; however, a running gag in the series is that she is sometimes interrupted by a sudden 
        appearance of Nobita (sometimes Doraemon, Gian, or Suneo) usually due to misuse of Doraemon's gadgets like the Anywhere Door (Doko Demo Doa
        in Japanese). Shizuka's skirt is also frequently seen getting flipped, either by Nobita misusing Doraemon's gadgets, or by the wind.
        Scenes in which her underwear is seen, or she is seen bathing, have been removed from the dubbed versions, especially in India, Europe, 
        the United States and the United Kingdom. Her true passions are sweet potatoes, which she would rather keep to herself, and the violin,
        for which her playing is just as horrendous as Gian's singing. She is also known for taking piano lessons reluctantly due to her mother's 
        wishes (as she loves violin more), which is sometimes a reason for  to hang out with friends (but she plays the piano better than   the violin).
        Shizuka is an animal lover and keeps two pets at home: a dog, who is saved from succumbing to illness by Nobita and Doraemon
        in one story; and a canary which runs away on multiple occasions and causes Shizuka and Nobita to run around the city chasing it down.</p></i></h3></div>
