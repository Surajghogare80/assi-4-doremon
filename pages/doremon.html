    <div><h3><i><p>Doraemon (Japanese: ドラえもん) is a fictional character in the Japanese manga and anime series of the same name created by Fujiko F.
         Fujio. Doraemon is a male robotic earless cat that travels back in time from the 22nd century to aid a preteen boy named Nobita. 
         An official birth certificate for the character gives him a birth date of 3 September 2112 and lists his city of residency as Kawasaki, 
         Kanagawa, the city where the manga was created.[6] In 2008, Japan's Foreign Ministry appointed Doraemon
          the country's "anime ambassador".</p></i></h3></div>

    <div><h3><i><p>Doraemon was originally conceived by Hiroshi Fujimoto following a series of three events. Firstly, when searching for ideas for a 
        new manga, he wished that a machine existed that would come up with ideas for him. Secondly, he tripped over his daughter's toy. 
        Thirdly, he heard cats fighting in his neighborhood.</p></i></h3></div>

    <div><h3><i><p>Doraemon is considered a substandard product because many of his robotic features (i.e. radar whiskers and cat-calling bell)
        
        malfunctioned after production due to an accident in the factory while he was being built. Due to this malfunction, Doraemon did not do well
         at the robot's school and during the final presentation show, he performed badly and nobody wanted to hire him, until baby Sewashi pushed the
          button. His parents were a bit reluctant, but since Sewashi liked him, they hired Doraemon, and he took care of him until Sewashi himself sent
           him to the past to take care of Nobita. Despite this, Doraemon shows a lot of intelligence and common sense. Whenever he hangs out with his
            friend, Mii-Chan (a cute street cat), he calls it 'important work' as an excuse for not doing chores that Nobita's mother asks him to do.
             As a robot, Doraemon can be programmed to complete a task by pushing a button on his nose, and can even shut down if his tail is pulled. 
             In a few episodes, Doraemon has been shown to be in danger of factory-resting,[8] or being on the verge of breaking.</p></u></i></h3></div>
